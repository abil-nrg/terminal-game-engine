My name is Abil, and this will be my project log for the terminal game engine project. My main goal is to be able to create an environment which is able to interact with the terminal
effectively turning the terminal into a pixelated graphical interface. This all will be written in C, for it BLAZING FAST runtime. 

Dec-8-2022:
	Found out about a "FULL BLOCK" Unicode character "\u2588" which you are able to print to the terminal, this will be my pixel. To color said pixel I will use the escape char
	and its colors
	COLOR		FOREGROUND		BACKGROUND
	Black		\033[30m		\033[40m
	Red		\033[31m		\033[41m
	Green		\033[32m		\033[42m
	Orange		\033[33m		\033[43m
	Blue		\033[34m		\033[44m
	Magenta		\033[35m		\033[45m
	Cyan		\033[36m		\033[46m
	Light Gray	\033[37m		\033[47m
	White		\033[38m		\033[48m
	Default		\033[39m		\033[49m
	
	FULL BLOCK	\u2588	

	a little table for quick access with cat less. My next goal is to have a 2d array which will store each pixel in its entry. Then there will be a function that prints it to the screen.
	Later I will need to be able to create sprites and assign those sprites with abilities to move and interact with eachother, but thats for later.
	My max resolution will be 48x190 rowsXcolumns. So that is 9120 max pixels that will be avaliable to me, at least on this laptop. How compeling of graphics you can create
	with those resolutions we will find out. For tonight I am done, figured out a way to represent pixels, wrote out the basic architecture of the files.
	Tomorrow, I will need to add a fill_background function and display scrreen function, after that the business of sprites will have to be dealt with.
